    * the future). The method through which tasks are added need then to be
    * able to accomodate these specifications.
    * The classes in this file are meant to fulfill the following points:
    *  - having strongly typed notions of weight, priority, ...
    *  - leting the user specify only part of those notions and rely on default
    *    value for the others.
    *  - allowing to use any order to give the arguments
    *  - while not having to multiply the overload for the method adding the
    *    task (there are 65 combinations!).

    * FIXME: should we add the notion of row selection here as well ?
