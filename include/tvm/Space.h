  /** Description of a variable space, and factory for Variable.
   *
   * The space can have up to 3 different sizes, although Euclidean spaces will
   * have only one :
   * - the size of the space as a manifold,
   * - the size of the vector needed to represent one variable (point) in this
   *   space (representation space, rsize),
   * - the size of the vector needed to represent a derivative (velocity,
   *   acceleration, ...) of this variable (tangent space, tsize).
   *
   * Here are a few examples:
   * - R^n has a size, rsize and tsize of n,
   * - SO(3), the 3d rotation space, when represented by quaternions, has a
   *   size of 3, a rsize of 4 and a tsize of 3,
   * - S(2), the sphere in dimension 3 has a size of 2, and rsize and tsize of 3.
