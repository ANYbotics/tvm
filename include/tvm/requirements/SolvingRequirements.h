  /** Note: when adding a task to a problem, the user will want to specify
   * part or all of the following: priority level, (global) weight,
   * different weights for each dimension, type of norm to consider (and
   * maybe more in the future). The method through which tasks are added
   * need then to be able to accomodate these specifications.
   *
   * The classes in this file are meant to fulfill the following points:
   *
   *  - having strongly typed notions of weight, priority, ...
   *
   *  - leting the user specify only part of those notions and rely on
   *  default value for the others.
   *
   *  - allowing to use any order to give the arguments
   *
   *  - while not having to multiply the overload for the method adding
   *  the task (there are 65 combinations!).
   *
   * FIXME: should we add the notion of row selection here as well ?
