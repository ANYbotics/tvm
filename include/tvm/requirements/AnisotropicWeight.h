  /** This class represents an anisotropic weight to give more or less
   * importance to the different rows of a constraint. It is given as a
   * vector w. It results in the violation v(x) of the constraint being
   * multiplied by diag(w'), where w' depends on the constraint violation
   * evaluation chosen.  w' is such that if w was a uniform vector with all
   * components equal to alpha, the result would be coherent with using a
   * Weight with value alpha.
   *
   * This class can be redundant with Weight, as having a Weight alpha and
   * an AnisotropicWeight w is the same as having a just an
   * AnisotropicWeight w.  As a guideline, it should be used only to
   * discriminate between the rows of a constraint, while Weight would be
   * used to discriminate between different constraints. As such the
   * "mean" value of w should be 1.
   *
   * This class replaces the notion of dimWeight in Tasks.
   *
   * The default value for this class is weights of 1 on every row.
   *
   * \internal FIXME Do we want to implement some kind of mechanism for constraints
   * whose size can change?
