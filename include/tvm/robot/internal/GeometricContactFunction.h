  /** Represents a geometric contact function
   *
   * Given a Contact (f1, f2) belonging to (r1, r2) this is the difference
   * between their current relative position and their initial relative
   * position. This is a function of r1.q and r2.q if r1 or r2 is not actuated,
   * then it is not taken into account in computations. If both are not
   * actuated this does nothing.
   *
   * The degrees of freedom computed by this function can be specified through
   * a 6x6 dof matrix.
   *
   * Outputs:
   *
   * - Value: dof*transformError(X_f1_f2, X_f1_f2_init)
   * - Velocity: dof*(f1.velocity - f2.velocity)
   * - NormalAcceleration: dof*(f1.NA - f2.NA)
   * - Jacobian: defined for r1.q as dof*f1.J and for r2.q as -dof*f2.J
